Hi, I'm Alex 'Jal' Counihan. I've been working in Aviation Data Science for the Royal Navy since 2019. Prior to that I spent 11 years working as an Aircraft Engineer.

As you can imagine a lot of the data I work with is Classified but I've kept the code/notebooks and Reports available on here that have been de-classified.

- 👀 I’m interested in leveraging ML/AI solutions to make people's lives easier and increase safety
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my Data Engineering skills by creating a full ETL pipeline for Aviation Maintenance Data within Foundry by Palantir. This pulls data from multiple sources within our Enterprise Data Warehouse to feed multiple reports and models
- 💞️ My guilty pleasure is using computer vision to automate PC Game tasks. These provide challenging environments with noisy backgrounds, dynamic camera angles and scaling image sizes
